List of problems solved:

1. ["Five programming problems every Software Engineer should be able to solve in less than 1 hour"] (https://www.shiftedup.com/2015/05/07/five-programming-problems-every-software-engineer-should-be-able-to-solve-in-less-than-1-hour)
  1. Write three functions that compute the sum of the numbers in a given list using a for-loop, a while-loop, and recursion.
  2. Write a function that combines two lists by alternatingly taking elements.
  3. Write a function that computes the list of the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. (Just calculating N number; solution can be easily modified into providing the list.)
  4. Write a function that given a list of non negative integers, arranges them such that they form the largest possible number.
