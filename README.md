# Problems

List of problems solved:

1. ["Five programming problems every Software Engineer should be able to solve in less than 1 hour"] (https://www.shiftedup.com/2015/05/07/five-programming-problems-every-software-engineer-should-be-able-to-solve-in-less-than-1-hour)
  1. Write three functions that compute the sum of the numbers in a given list using a for-loop, a while-loop, and recursion: [Solution](src/com/ampatalas/main/ListSum.java), [Unit tests](src/com/ampatalas/test/ListSumTest.java)
  2. Write a function that combines two lists by alternatingly taking elements: [Solution](src/com/ampatalas/main/MergeLists.java), [Unit tests](src/com/ampatalas/test/MergeListsTest.java)
  3. Write a function that computes the list of the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. (Just calculating N number; solution can be easily modified into providing the list.) [Solution](src/com/ampatalas/main/Fibonacci.java), [Unit tests](src/com/ampatalas/test/FibonacciTest.java)
  4. Write a function that given a list of non negative integers, arranges them such that they form the largest possible number: [Solution](src/com/ampatalas/main/LargestNumberArrangement.java), [Unit tests](src/com/ampatalas/test/LargestNumberArrangementTest.java)
  5. Write a program that outputs all possibilities to put + or - or nothing between the numbers 1, 2, ..., 9 (in this order) such that the result is always 100: [Solution](src/com/ampatalas/main/SumOf100.java)
